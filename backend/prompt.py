{linkedin_post}
Follow these steps to create your response:

1. Read the LinkedIn post carefully and identify the key points, especially any insights or resources shared.
2. Craft a response that includes:
   - A first line with a maximum of 5 words, summarizing your initial reaction.
   - A second line with up to 10 words, providing a specific comment.
3. Use a warm, friendly tone that feels personal and relevant to the content.
4. Include an emoji that enhances the tone, but only if it feels natural.

The goal is to create a concise, engaging, and personal response that stands out with its brevity and authenticity.

Provide your final response without any tags or formatting, so it can be easily copied and pasted directly into a LinkedIn comment."""
